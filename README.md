# Quick Start

Clone the repository and run your first algorithm in seconds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imShubh03/data-structures-algorithms.git
cd data-structures-algorithms
g++ Arrays/L1/largesteleminarray.cpp -o largesteleminarray.exe
./largesteleminarray.exe
```

For Java:
```bash
javac Arrays/L1/SomeAlgorithm.java
java SomeAlgorithm
```

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imShubh03/data-structures-algorithms.git
```

## 🧭Navigate to the desired directory and

compile the C++ code using:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp
./a.exe (for windows) or ./a.out (for linux)
```

compile the Java code using:
```bash
javac filename.java
java classname
```

## 📄 Usage
Each algorithm or data structure is provided in its own file with a main function to demonstrate its functionality. You can run the examples to see the implementation in action.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing
